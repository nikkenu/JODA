But it‚Äôs still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \ But that‚Äôs exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary‚Äôs opponent in this election. \ The FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary‚Äôs people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn‚Äôt be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \ The FBI‚Äôs leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI‚Äôs credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \ The covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama‚Äôs DOJ people has gone explosively public. \ The New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, ‚ÄúJames Comey Role Recalls Hoover‚Äôs FBI, Fairly or Not‚Äù practically admits up front that it‚Äôs spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey‚Äôs resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \ James Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the ‚Äúvast right wing conspiracy‚Äù was a stretch. \ Countless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what‚Äôs a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \ Senator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \ If James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \ Not too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner‚Äôs computer? \ Either Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he‚Äôs just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary‚Äôs victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \ The only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \ And it‚Äôs an interesting question. \ Hillary‚Äôs old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \ Pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \ There are two possible explanations. \ Hillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \ But the other explanation is that her people panicked. \ Going to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It‚Äôs an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that‚Äôs not hubris, it‚Äôs fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \ During the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \ There‚Äôs only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \ The Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it‚Äôs gone all in on fighting the FBI. It‚Äôs an unprecedented step born of fear. It‚Äôs hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \ Clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \ You can smell the fear. \ The FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It‚Äôs finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that‚Äôs here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn‚Äôt how you react to smoke. It‚Äôs how you respond to a fire. \ The misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \ The Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don‚Äôt want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \ The campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It‚Äôs also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It‚Äôs an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \ Hillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she‚Äôs never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.</td>       <td>FAKE</td>       <td>smell hillary fear daniel greenfield shillman journalism fellow freedom center new york writer focusing radical

Committed Political Suicide At A Trump Rally (VIDEO) Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \ There are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \ In a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : ‚ÄúRepublicans, it is time to come home‚Äù https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \ ‚Äî ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \ The Democratic Party couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan‚Äôs chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan‚Äôs career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \ The ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a ‚Äúprincipled‚Äù conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump‚Äôs unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan ‚Äì like many of his colleagues ‚Äì turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \ What‚Äôs especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn‚Äôt exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \ If 2016‚Äôs very ugly election has done any good it‚Äôs by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him.

Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday‚Äôs unity march against terrorism.\ \ Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\ \ The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\ \ The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday‚Äôs march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\ \ Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\ \ Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India‚Äôs prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi‚Äôs government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\ \ In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as ‚Äúquibbling a little bit.‚Äù He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\ \ ‚ÄúBut that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,‚Äù he said.\ \ ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt think the people of France have any doubts about America‚Äôs understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.‚Äù</td>       <td>REAL</td>       <td>kerry go paris gesture sympathy u secretary state john f kerry said monday stop paris later week amid criticism top american official attended sunday unity march terrorism kerry said expects arrive paris thursday evening head home week abroad said fly france conclusion series meeting scheduled thursday sofia bulgaria plan meet next day foreign minister laurent fabius president francois hollande return washington visit kerry ha family childhood tie country speaks fluent french could address criticism united state snubbed france darkest hour many year french press monday wa filled question neither president obama kerry attended sunday march leader nation obama wa said stayed away security need taxing country kerry prior commitment among roughly leader attend wa israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu stranger intense security marched beside hollande city street highest ranking u official attending march jane hartley ambassador france victoria nuland assistant secretary state european affair attorney general eric h holder jr wa paris meeting law enforcement official participate march kerry spent sunday business summit hosted india prime minister narendra modi united state eager india relax stringent law function barrier foreign investment hope modi government act open huge indian market american business news conference kerry brushed aside criticism united state sent senior official paris quibbling little bit noted many staffer american embassy paris attended march including ambassador said wanted present march could prior commitment india going way home make crystal clear passionately feel event taken place said think people france doubt america understanding happened personal sense loss deep commitment people france moment trauma</td>       <td>true</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <th>3</th>       <td>Bernie supporters on Twitter erupt in anger against the DNC: \'We tried to warn you!\' ‚Äî Kaydee King (@KaydeeKing) November 9, 2016 The lesson from tonight\'s Dem losses: Time for Democrats to start listening to the voters.

Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.\ \ "We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!" Sanders recently told supporters.\ \ While wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.\ \ Trump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state\'s 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.\ \ "We\'ve got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls," Trump urged supporters.\ \ Meanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he\'ll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\ \ Despite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn\'t lost momentum. He\'s hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he\'s talking about how he can win in November.\ \ "Because if I\'m the nominee, we win the General Election," Cruz promised his supporters. "We\'re beating Hillary in the key swing states, we\'re beating Hillary with Independents, we\'re beating Hillary with young people."\ \ For now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states.

Uuden datasetin testaaminen ei tuottanut haluttua lopputulosta, koska malli ennusti yli puolet v√§√§rin. Kuitenkin voin olla tyytyv√§inen harjoitusty√∂n lopputulokseen, koska koko prosessi oli hyvin opettavaista. Omasta mielest√§ parannettavaa on esimerkiksi datan siivouksen puolella sek√§ mallin luomisessa. Lis√§ksi mallille voisi antaa huomattavasti enemm√§n dataa, joka mahdollistaisi paremman luokittelun.

T√§m√§n kaltaista NLP-mallia voisi k√§ytt√§√§ monessa eri tilanteessa, esimerkiksi juuri Twitteriss√§. Hyvin koulutettu malli pystyisi rajoittamaan v√§√§r√§n tiedon levitt√§misen yhteiskunnassa. N√§it√§ onkin k√§yt√∂ss√§ huomattavan paljon ja ne ovat melko pinnalla nykyisen sotatilanteen takia. 

### L√§hteet
1. [New dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassanamin/textdb3?select=fake_or_real_news.csv)

### Pros & cons
1. Tulosten analysointi on hankalaa, koska mik√§√§n ei v√§ltt√§m√§tt√§ kerro onko uutinen feikki vai ei.
2. Mallin k√§ytt√§minen itsess√§√§n on melko yksinkertaista.
3. Vaikea l√∂ytyy syy ennustuksien huonouteen.
